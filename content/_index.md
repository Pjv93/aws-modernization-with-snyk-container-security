### Welcome!

In this workshop you will learn how to scan containerized applications on Amazon ECS using the new Docker Compose CLI tool developed in partnership with AWS and Docker. We will also learn about Continuous Integration with Snyk and Docker, as well as DevSecops using Snyk on AWS Code* Services.

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

Snyk is a Cloud Native Application Security solution that enables developers and security teams to find and automatically fix vulnerabilities in your source code, Infrastructure as code templates, container images, kubernetes applications, and open source artifacts.
