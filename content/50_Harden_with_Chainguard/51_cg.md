## Recap on Images

First, let's remind ourselves of the current vulnerability report for the `thumbnailer` image.

Return to the thumbnailer directory:

```
cd ../thumbnailer
```

And run the report:
```
snyk container test $REPO/thumbnailer --file=Dockerfile --exclude-app-vulns
```

This should show you something like:

```
...

Tested 429 dependencies for known issues, found 164 issues.

Base Image     Vulnerabilities  Severity
python:3.12.0  164              1 critical, 1 high, 5 medium, 157 low
...
```

And we can also check the size of the image:

```
docker images $REPO/thumbnailer:latest
```

Which should be similar to:

```
REPOSITORY                                                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
145201137172.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnailer   latest    c3d3afba8bd9   About an hour ago   1.03GB
```

## Changing to a Chainguard Base Image

Now let's try changing the base image to a Chainguard one.

Double click on the `Dockerfile` under the `thumbnailer` directory in your Cloud9 IDE sidebar and change the start of the file from:
```docker
FROM python:3.12.0
```
To:
```docker
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev
USER root
RUN apk add imagemagick
```

Also change the CMD on the last line from:

```docker
CMD ["python3","webapp.py"]
```
To:
```docker
CMD ["webapp.py"]
```

## Viewing the Results

Now, rebuild the image:
```bash
docker build -t $REPO/thumbnailer .
```
 ... and let's re-scan it:
```bash
snyk container test $REPO/thumbnailer --file=Dockerfile --exclude-app-vulns
```

The results should show a big reduction in vulnerabilities:
```text
...
âœ” Tested 67 dependencies for known issues, no vulnerable paths found.

Currently, we only offer base image recommendations for Official Docker images
```

The image size should also be significantly reduced. Try running:

```
docker images $REPO/thumbnailer
```


```text
REPOSITORY                                                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
145201137172.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnailer   latest    952b7d0abf76   About a minute ago   545MB
145201137172.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnailer   <none>    c3d3afba8bd9   2 hours ago          1.03GB
145201137172.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnailer   <none>    068e2a1bb86a   3 hours ago          941MB
```

The Chainguard image is around half the size of the previous version.

As before, you can push the image and deploy the application:


```sh
docker push $REPO/thumbnailer:latest
```

Followed by:

```sh
kubectl scale deployment thumbnailer --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment thumbnailer --replicas=1
```

In this section we've seen how simply changing the base image for a Chainguard one significantly
reduces the vulnerabilities and size of the image.

In the next section we'll see how we can make the image more appropriate to use in a production
setting.
