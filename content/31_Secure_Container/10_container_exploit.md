## Exploit a Container Vulnerability

Putting an application into a container does not automatically make it secure. To demonstrate the risks of a vulnerable component introduced by our container base image, we will exploit a vulnerability in the ImageMagick package present in our running application on EKS.

#TODO: Eric S to add the ImageMagick exploit instructions.

Continue to the next step to learn how to identify these, and other, vulnerabilities in your container images that are introduced by your container base image.
