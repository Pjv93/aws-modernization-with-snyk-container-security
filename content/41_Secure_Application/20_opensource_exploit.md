## Prepare to exploit a vulnerability in Goof. 

The `Goof` repo includes various exploits to demonstrate the risks of not addressing open source vulnerabilities. Let's execute an exploit against our running application! We'll demonstrate how the Directory Traversal vulnerability in the st package can lead to sensitive information leakage. 

First, let's set the GOOF_HOST environment variable to the endpoint of our application running on EKS.

```sh
GOOF_HOST=<EKS_URL>
```

Next, navigate to the exploits folder and source the st-exploits.sh file. This sets up a series of aliases to demonstrate the exploit. 

```sh
cd exploits && source st-exploits.sh
```

## Exploit a vulnerability in Goof. 

Run the aliases as demonstrated below. The good stuff is in `st4` and `st5`, which leak the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file in our container image!

```sh
st1
st2
st3
st4
st5
```

This is one example of an open source vulnerability in the very vulnerable Goof application. In the next step, we'll upgrade the `st` component to address this vulnerability.
